      <h1>What is Ballet?</h1>
      <hr>
      <h2>Ballet is an art form created by the movement of the human body.</h2>
      <p>It is theatrical – performed on a stage to an audience utilizing costumes, scenic design and lighting. It can
        tell a story or express a thought, concept or emotion. Ballet dance can be magical, exciting, provoking or
        disturbing.</p>

        <h2>Types of Ballet</h2>
        <img src="./assets/img_2/pexels-pixabay-209948.jpg" alt="Example plotless ballets">
        <p><strong>Story ballets</strong> tell a story. They contain narrative action, characters, a beginning and an
          end. The Nutcracker and The Sleeping Beauty are famous story ballets from the 19th century; classic stories
          and novels such as The Great Gatsby and The Three Musketeers also have been transformed into ballets.</p>
        <p><strong>Plotless ballets</strong> have no storyline. Instead they use the movement of the body and theatrical
          elements to interpret music, create an image or express or provoke emotion. Choreographer George Balanchine
          was a prolific creator of plotless ballets.</p>

        <p><strong>Classical ballet</strong> is what people generally think of first when it comes to “ballet.”
          Classical ballet reached its height in 19th- century Russia through the work of choreographers like Marius
          Petipa and Lev Ivanov. </p>
        <p><strong>Neo-classical ballet</strong> was introduced in the 20th century by choreographers like George
          Balanchine.</p>
        <p><strong>Contemporary ballet</strong> is influenced by modern dance. Renowned contemporary ballet
          choreographers include Twyla Tharp, Jiří Kylián, Paul Taylor, William Forsythe and Dwight Rhoden.</p>

        <h3>Origin of Ballet</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Ballet originated in the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th century. Noblemen and women were treated to
          lavish events, especially wedding celebrations, where dancing and music created an elaborate spectacle.
          Dancing masters taught the steps to the nobility, and the court participated in the performances. In the 16th
          century, Catherine de Medici — an Italian noblewoman, wife of King Henry II of France and a great patron of
          the arts — began to fund ballet in the French court. Her elaborate festivals encouraged the growth of ballet
          de cour, a program that included dance, decor, costume, song, music and poetry.</p>

        <h3>The 19th Century</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Early classical ballets such as Giselle and La Sylphide were created during the Romantic Movement in the
          first half of the 19th century. This movement influenced art, music and ballet. It was concerned with the
          supernatural world of spirits and magic and often showed women as passive and fragile. These themes are
          reflected in the ballets of the time and are called romantic ballets. This is also the period of time when
          dancing on the tips of the toes, known as pointe work, became the norm for the ballerina. The romantic tutu, a
          calf-length, full skirt made of tulle, was introduced.</p>

        <h3>Ballet Today</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>In the early part of the 20th century, Russian choreographers Sergei Diaghilev and Michel Fokine began to
          experiment with movement and costume, moving beyond the confines of classical ballet form and story. Diaghilev
          collaborated with composer Igor Stravinsky on the ballet The Rite of Spring, a work so different —with its
          dissonant music, its story of human sacrifice and its unfamiliar movements — that it caused the audience to
          riot. Choreographer and New York City Ballet founder George Balanchine, a Russian who emigrated to America,
          would change ballet even further.</p>
