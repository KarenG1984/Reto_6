        <h3>Astronauts</h3>
        <p>The term "astronaut" derives from the Greek words meaning "space sailor," and refers to all who have been
          launched as crew members aboard NASA spacecraft bound for orbit and beyond. The term "astronaut" has been
          maintained as the title for those selected to join the NASA corps of astronauts who make "space sailing" their
          career profession.</p>

        <h3>Space Tech</h3>
        <p>NASA collaborates with U.S. universities in several ways, including the Space Technology Research Grants
          program. Six university-led research proposals have been selected to study early-stage technologies. The
          grants allow untenured, assistant professors early in their careers to research technologies high on NASA’s
          radar.</p>

        <h3>Flight</h3>
        <p>A one-megawatt electric motor that could help propel future, more environmentally friendly and economically
          sustainable aircraft was tested during April and May by NASA and its industry and academic partners.

          The center of attention is an electric machine that can work either as an electric motor to turn propellers or
          large engine fans, or a generator to produce one million watts of power – enough to power 760 average U.S.
          households.</p>

      <h2>Earth System Observatory</h2>
      <p>NASA will design a new set of Earth-focused missions to provide key information to guide efforts related to
        climate change, disaster mitigation, fighting forest fires, and improving real-time agricultural processes. With
        the Earth System Observatory, each satellite will be uniquely designed to complement the others, working in
        tandem to create a 3D, holistic view of Earth, from bedrock to atmosphere.</p>
